# prism:  
Partially Recursively Induced Structured Moderation  
***  
## Description:  
We formulate a new highly interpretable tree-based modeling framework that allows for automatic discovery of potentially non-linear hierarchical interactions between health determinants at multiple levels (individual factors and contextual factors) and differences in survival outcomes between groups of interest. Inferential, predictive and visualization strategies are also developed. Finally, a new variable importance measurement is derived, so a local vimp (Lvimp), which helps to understand the individual level variables that are driving each terminal node.
